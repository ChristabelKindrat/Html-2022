    Homer J. Simpson was born on May 12, 1951 to Abraham Simpson II and Mona Olsen. He was raised on the Simpson family
    farm until they were forced to move out due to Homer jumping out of a hay bale and scaring the cows into giving sour
    milk, causing the bank to foreclose it. At some point in his childhood, Homer began drinking alcohol like his father
    and accidentally caused a traffic jam in a Playskool car.

<ul>
  <li>“Marge, I have always carried myself with a certain quiet dignity. Tonight, you robbed me of it.”
      ―Homer Simpson</li>
    <li>“Look, Marge. You don't know what it's like. I'm the one out there putting his ass on the line. And I'm not out
        of order. You're out of order! The whole freakin' system is out of order. You want the truth? You want the
        truth? You can't handle the truth! 'Cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that was your
        best friend's face, you'll know what to do! Forget it, Marge. It's Chinatown!”
      ―Homer Simpson</li>
    <li>“How dare you talk about Ned Flanders like that. He's a wonderful, kind, caring man. Maybe even more so than me.
        There have been times when I lost patience with him, even lashed out at him, but this man has turned every cheek
        on his body. If everyone here were like Ned Flanders, there'd be no need for Heaven. We'd already be there.”
      ―Homer Simpson</li>
